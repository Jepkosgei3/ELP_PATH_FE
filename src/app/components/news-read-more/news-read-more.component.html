        <p>The Wings to Fly Scholarship Program selection process has kicked off across the country, with bright children from financially challenged backgrounds who sat the 2022 KCPE exams and who attained 350 and above having an opportunity to be selected to attend interviews.

            Thousands of primary school leavers from all over the country appeared before the Community Scholarship Selection Boards (CSSBs) accompanied by their parents or guardians.
            
            The CSSBs consist of key personalities from the communities, and each is chaired by the Sub-County Director of Education.
